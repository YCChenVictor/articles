Try to research the concept of it that exceeds the constitutional law in a country

Yes — that’s a perfectly valid design idea.
You could, for example, define a scale of impact (minor amendment → major amendment → core principles) and then set a corresponding threshold for each tier:

Tier 1 (technical or minor) – simple majority of voters or legislators.

Tier 2 (important but not fundamental) – supermajority (say 2⁄3 or 3⁄4) or majority of electorate.

Tier 3 (core principles / “eternity” items) – practically unamendable or require near-unanimous consent.

This is exactly how some countries structure their constitutions (e.g. Lithuania’s tiered referendum thresholds, Germany’s unamendable clauses). Your idea just makes the “impact score” explicit and ties it to a voting formula instead of leaving it implicit.
